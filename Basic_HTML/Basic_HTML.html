h1 elements are often used for main headings,
while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings.
There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

<!-- HTML5 INTRO
HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML,
make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.
-->
<main>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
<hr>

<!-- ADDING IMAGES
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.
Note that img elements are self-closing.
All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to
improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
-->
<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg" alt="Author standing on a beach with two thumbs up.">
<hr>

<!-- ADD EXERNAL PAGES WITH ANCHOR TAG AND DEAD LINK
a elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text.
Replace the href attribute value with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.
-->
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>
<a href="#">cat photos</a>
<hr>

<!-- OPEN IN NEW WINDOW
the (target="_blank") attribute from the anchor tag causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.
-->
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>
<hr>

<!-- INTERNAL SECTION USING ANCHOR TAG
To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the
element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page.
You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
-->
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
<hr>

<!-- IMAGE AS A LINK
You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.
-->
<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera."></a>
<hr>

<!-- CREATE A LIST

Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, ordered lists are closed with the </ol> tag.
-->
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>

<!-- TEXT FIELD AND PLACE HOLDER
input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user. Note that input elements are self-closing.
Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.
-->
<input type="text">
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
<hr>

<!-- FORM ELEMENT
-->
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>

<!-- SUBMIT BUTTON
-->
<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
<hr>

<!-- REQUIRED FIELD
if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element.
-->
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<hr>

<!-- RADIO BUTTONS
Radio buttons are a type of input.
Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a
label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group.
By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within
the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
-->
<label for="indoor">
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
<hr>
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
    <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<hr>

<!-- CHECKBOXES
Checkboxes are a type of input.
Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a
label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.
All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.
It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its
corresponding label by setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.
-->
<label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
<hr>
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>

    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>

    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<hr>

<!-- VALUE ATTRIBUTE
When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected.
Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.
-->
<label for="indoor">
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
<label for="outdoor">

<!-- DOCTYPE
You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line,  where the ... part is the version of HTML.
For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.
The '!' and uppercase 'DOCTYPE' is important, especially for older browsers. The 'html' is not case sensitive.
Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line,
and the closing </html> goes at the end of the page.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Here Goes the CODE</h1>
</html>
<hr>

<!-- HEAD AND BODY
Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of
the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.
Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The best page ever</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The best page ever</h1>
